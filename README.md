# Tiny Search Engine

This search engine is a small, simplified search engine that consists of sub-systems: a crawler, an indexer, and a querier. It crawls a web server from a seed URL, indexes the words found in the HTML files, and accepts queries to return a list of relavent web pages for a certain phrase.
